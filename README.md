#  📝Theme
The importance of traffic rules and road safety is universally acknowledged, underscoring the need for early education and continuous learning through engaging methods like videos, documentation, and workshops to instill lifelong good habits and ensure road safety for all.
# 🌵Problem statement
 Traffic rules and road safety is such an important topic that it is taught to us from an early age in not only India but also in most countries.
Teaching traffic rules at a young age instills good habits that children carry into adulthood. But no matter the age, how can one individual
effectively learn about the traffic rules? Popular choices of teaching about the traffic rules are – through videos, documentations or workshops
held by Government or any organizations. But there are some problems with this approach :

* **Monotonous Learning** – These approach is often very monotonous and fails to engage. Lack of interactivity leads the learners to lose interest
very quickly. Also, passive viewing doesn’t encourage active participation or critical thinking.

* **Low Retention and Engagement** - Studies show that people retain only 10-20% of what they read or hear. Also, lack of interactive elements
leads to disinterest.

* **Lack of Real-time Feedback and Interaction** - Traditional methods do not provide instant feedback on the learner's understanding or
mistakes. Delayed correction can reinforce incorrect behaviours or misunderstandings.

* **Absence of Practical Scenarios** - Most traditional methods focus on theoretical knowledge without practical application. Real-world
scenarios and simulations help in better understanding and applying traffic rules. Learning in context (e.g., simulations of actual driving
situations) improves comprehension and recall.
# 🔑Solution
* **Practical Scenarios and Simulation**:
Street Savvy offers practical scenarios that simulate real-life traffic situations, helping players apply their knowledge. Levels are designed to cover basic to advanced traffic rules, ensuring comprehensive learning.

* **Voice-Enabled AI Assistant**:
Street Savvy features a built-in AI Assistant that functions like a personal driving assistant. It notifies the driver about traffic signals and lights, providing advice on how to handle these scenarios.

* **AI Chatbot**:
For drivers who have any confusion or want to know additional details regarding any traffic rule, they can ask the bot for insights.

* **Voice Interaction with the Chatbot**:
Recognizing that texting with the bot while driving isn't always efficient, Street Savvy includes a feature that allows players to talk to the bot and receive voice responses.

* **Benefits of Interactive Learning**:
Interactive elements and gamification significantly increase user engagement compared to traditional methods. The practical applications and AI Driving Assistant ensure a deeper understanding of traffic rules and their importance.

* **C#** : Used to build the front end of the application.
* **Unity** to generate 3D animated graphics and created a three-level learning module for driving rules
* **Microsoft Azure App Service**: Deployed the application for global access.
* **Microsoft Azure Conversational AI Service**: Created a responsive chatbot to effectively understand text.
# 👩‍🏫Challenges and Workarounds
* Overcoming the limitations of the stage
* Resolving Dependency Issues in the Azure Function: Actively troubleshoot and systematically debug dependency conflicts or compatibility issues encountered within the Azure function.
* Managing the limitations of a Q&A chatbot conversation paragraph
