#  📝Theme
The importance of traffic rules and road safety is universally acknowledged, underscoring the need for early education and continuous learning through engaging methods like videos, documentation, and workshops to instill lifelong good habits and ensure road safety for all.
# 🌵Problem statement
 Problem Statement: 

Our project addresses the critical issue of road safety and driver education in India. Despite existing regulations, India continues to have one of the highest rates of traffic accidents and fatalities in the world. A major contributing factor is the lack of comprehensive understanding and adherence to traffic rules among drivers. But why is this?


* **Lack of Engagement in Traditional Teaching Methods** : Traditional methods of teaching traffic rules and road safety, such as documentation, static lessons, or workshops, lack effectiveness in engaging learners.

* **Absence of Interactivity** : Current driver education programs often lack interactivity and real-time feedback, both of which are essential for effective learning.

* **Absence of Real-Life Scenarios** : The education provided does not focus on real-life scenarios that can occur on the road, which is crucial for practical application and preparedness.

* **Cost Issue** : The traditional way of learning to drive can be costly and sometimes is not affordable for most people. 

* **Kids do not feel engaged** : Basic traffic rules and road safety have been taught to kids from an early age, but the methods used are dull and non-interactive.

# 🔑Solution
Introducing “Street Savvy” an interactive solution to learn about the traffic rules powered by Azure AI Services. This solution tackles all the prevalent problems head-on by harnessing the power of Azure AI services and Unity Engine. Street Savvy provides the following features: 

* **Engaging learning**: Street Savvy is a gamified interactive simulation to educate people about the Indian Traffic Rules.

* **AI Assistant** : Street Savvy has a built-in AI assistant that works as a personalised driving assistant. It feels like the player is driving with a driving assistant sitting beside them who will give guidance and teach the traffic rules.

* **Chat and Learn** : While driving, if the player has any additional questions about specific traffic rules, they can directly chat with the bot anytime and by utilising Azure AI Bot services, the player will get instant answers.

* **Voice Interaction** : Harnessing the power of Azure AI Speech, the bot can also talk and understand what the player is saying so the player can have a conversation with the bot while learning about the traffic rules.

* **Real-Life Scenarios** : Each level of Street Savvy aims to focus on real-life scenarios that can occur on the road.

* **Cost-Effective Solution** : Traditional driver education can be expensive and time-consuming. Street Savvy provides an AI-powered alternate solution that can both save time and money.

* **Interactive Learning for Kids** : Street Savvy can also serve as an educational tool for children, helping them learn about traffic signals and rules from a young age. By making traffic education fun and interactive, we aim to instil good habits early on, fostering a generation of more informed and responsible road users.
